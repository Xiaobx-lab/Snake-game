### Requirement Analysis: 

After registering and logging in, the user enters the Snake game. The snake's movement direction is controlled using the WASD keys. The snake can consume different buffs, each producing a different effect. The game ends when the snake hits a wall or bites its own body, and the game result and score are displayed. The result is then submitted to the database.

### Technologies Used: 

GUI, MySQL, DBUtil, and reflection techniques for object creation, etc.

### Design Patterns: 

The code is structured following the MVC pattern, and design patterns such as the Strategy pattern are utilized.

### Features:

1. Optimize snake skins and add a dressing buff.
2. Random appearance of all buffs in the game panel, with different buffs appearing at irregular intervals.
3. Add a protective shield function. When the snake has a shield, it enters an invincible state, reducing all damage to zero.
4. Add a music thread.
